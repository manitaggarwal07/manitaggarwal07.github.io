<h4>    Large masses of land and wide bodies of water known as continents and oceans comprise the environment we have on Earth. As beautiful as it may look now, it has
not always been like this. Events that took place from the earliest single-celled life until the Ice Ages have resulted in that single huge mass of Earth splitting and
separating from each other bordered by the bodies of water. The 7 continents were the results of this process that is still ongoing.</h4>

<h4>    Coming behind <em>Asia</em> in terms of being the largest and most populous continent is<em> Africa.</em> At 11.7 million square miles, it covers 6% of the Earth’s total surface
area and 20% of its land area. With 1.2 billion people as of 2016, it interprets 16% of the world’s human population.<em> Africa</em>, based on theories of paleoanthropologists
considered to be the oldest inhabited territory. Fossils discovered in the 20th century proved human occupation as early as 7 million years ago. The climate in <em>Africa</em> 
which ranges from tropical to subarctic on its highest peaks have made it the ideal environment for a lot of endangered species.</h4>



<h2  align="center">                                                                          2.) <em>Antarctica</em>                                          </h2>


<h4>The fifth-largest continent is <em>Antarctica</em>. With 5.4 million square miles it is about 1.3 times as large as <em>Europe</em>. Being the Earth’s southernmost continent located
in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, it contains the geographic South Pole. About 98% of this continent is covered by ice sheets averaging at least 1.6 
kilometers thick. It is the coldest of Earth’s continents. As the weather makes it unbearable to live, only about 1000-5000 people inhabit <em>Antarctica</em>. There is no 
economic activity here except for fishing and small scale tourism.

Only animals adapted to dryness and low temperatures are common in <em>Antarctica</em>. Low temperatures and high exposure caused little biodiversity here compared to the rest 
of the world.</h4>


<h2  align="center">                                                                            3.) <em>Asia</em>                                          </h2>


<h4><em>Asia</em> is the largest and most populous continent on Earth. Located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemisphere, it is bordered by the Pacific Ocean, Indian 
Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. <em>Asia</em> covers Earth’s total surface area by 71.n square miles and has the largest coastline at 39,022 miles as well. This is home to 4.5 
billion people from about 50 countries.

There is no clear geographical separation between <em>Europe</em> and <em>Asia</em> therefore they are commonly called <em>EurAsia</em>. Only a historical and cultural construct stands as the 
border between the two. Given the land size, and the huge amount of people, diversity varies across regions with regard to ethnic groups, culture, economics and 
government systems.</h4>




<h2  align="center">                                                                            4.) <em>Australia</em>                                          </h2>

<h4>Situated in the graphical region in Oceania, <em>Australia</em> is the smallest of the continents. Its total land area of 3.3 million square miles, it is home to 29 million
of the world’s population and biodiversity. As the rest of the world undergoes significant cooling, <em>Australia</em> has its global cooling effect remain reasonably constant
by its gradual movement toward the equator. For that, enormous diversity of animal, fungal and plant life have developed.

The earliest human migrations including those from out of Africa make up the original inhabitants of the <em>Australia</em>n continent. Immigration to this continent has brought 
overseas languages that makeup about 200 that they have. Large proportions of <em>Australia</em> belong to no region while Christianity is predominant in those practising faith.
As a small continent, as it is, they have <em>Australia</em> which is the only first-world country having the largest and most dominant economy in the region. They have a 
federal parliamentary constitutional monarchy with two major political groups that form the government.

<h4>Bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Mediterranean Sea to the south is the continent of <em>Europe</em> located entirely in the
Northern Hemisphere and mostly in the Eastern Hemisphere. The second smallest continent covers about 3.9 million square miles or 2% of Earth’s surface. It is divided 
into fifty sovereign states with Russian Federation having the largest and most populous.

Ancient Greece in <em>Europe</em> was the birthplace of Western Civilization. Between 16th and 20th centuries, it controlled at various times the Americas, almost all of Africa
and the majority of <em>Asia</em>. Two world wars and an economic depression drew most <em>Europe</em>an nations that dominated the early 20th century. <em>Europe</em> has a continually evolving
politics factored by the historical events within the continent.</h4>

<h4><em>North America</em> covers an area of about 9.5 million square miles or 16.5% of Earth’s land area and 4.8 of its total surface. It is the third-largest by area and the
fourth by population. North America has many regions and sub-regions. The largest countries of this continent are Canada and the United States. By demographics, North 
America is ethnically diverse as there are groups of Cauc<em>Asia</em>ns, Mestizos, and Blacks. A significant minority of Indigenous Americans and <em>Asia</em>ns are present. North 
America’s Economy is flawless and when their GDP per capita was evaluated in October 2016, it appeared as the richest continent in the world.

<h4><em>South America </em> also considered as a subcontinent of the Americas is a continent in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in the Southern Hemisphere with a small portion in
the Northern Hemisphere. It is the fourth largest continent with an area of 6.8 million square miles. The population is the 5th amongst the 7 continents at nearly more
than 420 million. The majority of the population live near the continent’s western or eastern coasts.

The long history of colonialism,the majority of <em>South America </em>ns speak Spanish. Indigenous people’s interaction with <em>Europe</em>an conquerors and immigrants was the basis of
the continent’s cultural and ethnic outlook. <em>South America </em> has been home to many interesting species of animals. The rainforests of the Amazon has made this continent
one of the most biodiverse. <em>South America </em> relies on the export of manufactured goods and natural resources. In terms of politics, all <em>South America </em>n countries are 
presidential republics except for Peru which is a semi-presidential republic and Suriname, a parliamentary republic.</h4>
