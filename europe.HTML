<h1 align="center">      <b><em><hr> EUROPE</b></em></h1>
<p><font color="red";><em>Europe</em></font> consists of 52 different countries with a total land area of 10 million km² (4 million square miles). This corresponds to a share of 7% of the habitable earth surface.
 The coastlines in and around Europe altogether have a length of 112,483 km (69,909 miles). In these 52 countries are living 734.99 million people (= 9.5% of the world's population).
 They account for around 25% of global economic output.

Russia is also considered a European country here. Although only 23% of Russia's territory is in Europe, 85% of all inhabitants live here. Furthermore, Moscow is located west of the 
Ural Mountains, which forms the border between Europe and Asia.

The European part of Turkey, on the other hand, is only inhabited by 12% of the country's population and accounts for just 3% of the total area. The capital is geographically not in 
Europe, which is why Turkey is to be assigned to Western Asia.</p>
