<h1 align="center">      <b><em><hr> AUSTRALIA</b></em></h1>
<p>With<font color="red";><em> Australia</em></font> you usually connect only the largest landmass of the Australian country, but the continent itself consists of several 
countries. Strictly taken, the Heard and McDonald Islands also belong to the country of Australia but are geographically attributed to the Antarctic continent.

Australia consists of 6 different countries with a total land area of 8 million km² (3 million square miles). This corresponds to a share of 5% of the habitable earth surface. The 
coastlines in and around Australia altogether have a length of 41,193 km (25,602 miles). In these 6 countries are living 30.78 million people (= 0.4% of the world's population).
 They account for around 1.8% of global economic output.

The indigenous population of the various countries is extremely diverse and is made up of different cultures, religions and origins. On the main Australian island, the original 
population consisted of Aborigines and the Torres Strait Islanders (islands northeast of the main island). On the western islands there were mainly Papuan, Polynesian and 
Melanesian peoples. Due to the immigration and colonization of the last two centuries, the indigenous population has decimated considerably. In the meantime, European 
descendants - above all the British - represent by far the largest share.

The Aborigines only have a population share of less than 2% in the country of Australia. Tasmanian Aboriginals were considered died out in the meantime, 
but today's
 population is estimated to be between 6,000 and 23,000 again, depending on the counting method.
